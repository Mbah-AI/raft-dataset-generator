The fiber optic system transmits light from a high-intensity lamp to a blanket containing fiber optics..\nMost of these devices emit enough light in the blue-green region of the visible spectrum to be effective for standard phototherapy. However, when bilirubin levels reach the range where intensive phototherapy is recommended, maximum efficiency must be achieved. The most effective light source currently available commercially for phototherapy is a special blue fluorescent tube 38 or a specially designed LED lamp (Natus Inc., San Carlos, CA). Special blue fluorescent tubes are labeled F20T12/BB (General Electric, Westinghouse, Sylvania) or TL52/20W (Phillips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). It is important to note that special blue tubes provide a greater irradiance than regular blue tubes (labeled F20T12/B) (Figure 11). Special blue tubes are the most effective because they provide light that is predominantly in the blue-green spectrum..At this wavelength, light easily penetrates the skin and is maximally absorbed by bilirubin. There is a misconception that fluorescent tubes for phototherapy use ultraviolet light. In fact, fluorescent tubes emit only a small amount of ultraviolet light with a wavelength longer than the ultraviolet light that causes erythema.

C.1.3 Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette Prevention and control of the spread of pathogens from infected patients (source prevention and control) is key to avoiding transmission from unprotected contact. For diseases transmitted by large droplets and/or droplet nuclei, respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette should be practiced by all persons showing symptoms of respiratory infection (60). All persons (healthcare workers, patients, and visitors) showing signs and symptoms of respiratory infection should: n cover their mouth and nose when coughing/sneezing; n use a tissue, handkerchief, linen mask, or surgical mask if available, as source prevention and control to contain respiratory secretions, and dispose of them in a waste bin; n use a surgical mask when coughing/sneezing when possible; and n perform hand hygiene.

C.1.4 Environmental controls: cleaning and disinfection Viruses and bacteria that cause ARDs can survive in the environment for varying periods of time (hours to days); the environmental bioburden can be reduced by cleaning, and infectious agents can be inactivated by the use of standard hospital disinfectants. Environmental cleaning and disinfection are intended to remove pathogens or significantly reduce their numbers on contaminated surfaces and objects, thereby interrupting the chain of transmission.

A seizure lasting longer than\xa05\xa0minutes (or 2 or more seizures in 5 minutes without\ncomplete restoration of baseline consciousness\xa0between seizures) is a medical emergency, see\xa0Generalised tonic-\nclonic seizures and convulsive status epilepticus, Chapter 1.\nClinical features\nManifestations of epilepsy (i.e. seizures) are varied. It is critical to recognize the type of seizure to determine patient\nmanagement.\nSeizures are classiﬁed as follows :\xa0Generalized onset seizures\n\xa0Focal onset seizures\n\xa0Epilepsy is clinically diagnosed when 2 or more ""unprovoked"" seizures (i.e. seizures not caused by a temporary\nreversible condition) of any type occur more than 24 hours apart .\nTreatment principles\nRarely, ASMs may cause a paradoxical increase in seizure frequency, mainly at the start of treatment or after an\nincrease in dose.\n [1] \nTonic-clonic seizures:\xa0contraction of muscles, including respiratory muscles (tonic phase), followed by rhythmic\njerking of the arms and legs (clonic phase) and\xa0loss of consciousness;\nMyoclonic seizures: sudden and brief contractions of a muscle or group of muscles;\nAtonic seizures: sudden loss of muscle tone, frequently resulting in falls;\nAbsence seizures:\xa0brief (a few seconds) impairment of consciousness and cessation of activity; most common in\nchildren from 4 years of age.\nStart with localised symptoms (e.g.\xa0jerking movements of one body part or repetitive lips smacking) and sometimes\nspread to\xa0the rest of the body, becoming generalised.\n [2] [3] \nOnce the diagnosis of epilepsy (or seizures requiring long-term treatment) has been made, an antiseizure medication\n(ASM) is prescribed to prevent the occurrence of new seizures.\nThe treatment prescribed should be a monotherapy (i.e. a single ASM).\nFor choosing an ASM, see\xa0Choice of an antiseizure medication. The likelihood of continued ASM availability should\nalso be considered when making the choice.\nTreatment should be taken daily without interruption for the long term. Abruptly stopping or reducing an ASM dose is\nlikely to provoke seizures.\nLong-term patient follow-up is required, see\xa0Patient follow-up. Any change in treatment (dose increments, ASM\nsubstitution or discontinuation) requires close clinical monitoring.\nIf seizures are not controlled, assess adherence to treatment, consider increasing the dose if tolerated, up to the\nmaximum dose if necessary..'}","{'id': 'chunk-56f4e2c0e33547fe91b7def4e41e759e', 'content': '- 72 -.'}","{'id': 'chunk-1342997bb0044b4c89ea8b240a3bad86', 'content': '-83- (68%) had ABG results ≤20 dB, where 74 (22%) had ABG results ≤10 dB.

The disease is endemic in the\npoorest rural areas of Africa, Asia, Central and South America and the Middle East.\nInfection is usually ﬁrst contracted early in childhood by direct or indirect contact (dirty hands, contaminated towels,\nﬂies). In the absence of hygiene and effective treatment, the inﬂammation intensiﬁes with successive infections,\ncausing scars and deformities on the upper tarsal conjunctiva. The resulting ingrowing eyelashes (trichiasis) cause\ncorneal lesions followed by permanent blindness, usually in adulthood.\nThe WHO classiﬁes trachoma into 5 stages. Early diagnosis and treatment of ﬁrst stages is essential to avoid the\ndevelopment of trichiasis and associated complications.\nClinical features\nSeveral stages can occur simultaneously :\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\nTreatment\n\xa0\n\xa0\n [1] [2] \nStage 1: trachomatous inﬂammation - follicular (TF)\nPresence of ﬁve or more follicles in the upper tarsal conjunctiva.

The blood vessels, normally visible, are masked by a\ndiffuse inﬂammatory inﬁltration or follicles.\nStage 3: trachomatous scarring (TS)\nFollicles disappear, leaving scars: scars are white lines, bands or patches in the tarsal conjunctiva.\nStage 4: trachomatous trichiasis (TT)\nDue to multiple scars the margin of the eyelid, usually the upper lid, turns inwards (entropion); the eyelashes rub\nagainst the cornea and cause ulcerations and chronic inﬂammation.\nStage 5: corneal opacity (CO)\nCornea gradually loses its transparency, leading to visual impairment and blindness.\nStages 1 and 2:\nClean eyes and face several times per day.\nAntibiotic treatment :\nThe treatment of choice is azithromycin PO:\nChildren: 20 mg/kg single dose\nAdults: 1 g single dose\nFailing the above, 1% tetracycline eye ointment: one application 2 times daily for 6 weeks, or, as a last resort,\nerythromycin PO: 20 mg/kg (max. 1 g) 2 times daily for 14 days.\n [3] \nStage 3: no treatment\nStage 4: surgical treatment\nWhile waiting for surgery, if regular patient follow-up is possible, taping eyelashes to the eyelid is a palliative\nmeasure that can help protect the cornea.

This sequence has advantages because the imaging matrix is larger, the sections are thinner, and there is minimal susceptibility to artifacts. Foer, et al conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the benefits of non-EPI DW in detecting residual cholesteatoma in patients after canal wall-up mastoidectomy, compared with second-look surgery findings and obtained a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 100%, NPP of 100%, and NPN of 90%.33 These results are also supported by research by Garrido L, et al who found that the sensitivity, specificity, NPP, and NPN of non-EPI DW MRI in detecting recurrent cholesteatoma were 100%, 66.7%, 90.9%, and 100%. These two studies stated that non-EPI DW MRI has limitations in detecting cholesteatoma measuring less than 2 mm, but considering the greater risk of second-look surgery, such as hearing loss, vertigo, facial nerve and chorda tympani trauma, and the higher costs incurred with surgery, non-EPI DW MRI can be the modality of choice for detecting residual cholesteatoma after mastoidectomy surgery.

In addition, parasitic infections also contribute to iron deficiency, especially in developing countries.[5] 3. EPIDEMIOLOGY WHO reported that the prevalence of anemia in infants and children (6-59 months) in America in 2011 was 6%. [14] Based on data from 2010, the prevalence of anemia in low-income populations increased from 13.4% in 2001 to 14.6% in 2010. The highest prevalence of anemia was found in children aged 12–17 months.[15,16] Several risk factors for anemia found in children are age 6–23 months, living in urban areas, mothers without formal education, mothers with an education level equivalent to primary education, monthly family income &lt; 750 ETB, family income 750–1500 ETB, initiation of complementary foods for breast milk under six months, and underweight.[17] Prematurity, history of exclusive breastfeeding without iron-fortified diet intake after six months, introduction of cow&#39;s milk at an age earlier than one year, low socioeconomic status, dietary restrictions on vegetarians, diarrhea and chronic diseases are also risk factors for iron deficiency anemia.[18,19] 4. CLINICAL FINDINGS Most infants and children with mild anemia do not show severe clinical symptoms and signs. The preliminary evaluation that needs to be done includes a history of the disease such as a history of premature birth, low birth weight, diet, chronic diseases, and a family history of anemia. In addition, it is necessary to ask about risk factors for iron deficiency anemia such as low birth weight, history of prematurity, exposure to heavy metals, history of exclusive breastfeeding for more than four months, and diet without iron fortification in children.[20] The CDC recommends early detection of iron deficiency anemia in children aged 9-12 months in the lower middle class. In addition, early detection in premature and low birth weight infants before the age of six months if the infant is not given an iron-fortified diet.[21] A complete blood count is the first laboratory test performed to evaluate anemia and allows differentiation of microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias based on mean corpuscular volume.[1] In iron deficiency anemia, as with other anemia diagnoses, laboratory tests may be performed if there are no clinical symptoms. Progressive and gradual pallor may go unnoticed by the patient&#39;s family. The most prominent research finding in iron deficiency anemia is its effects on the neurocognitive system. Many prospective studies have found that retardation occurs.'}","{'id': 'chunk-b78c61d4005a4ea9ada34016bff9a3fd', 'content': '8.

There are 8 countries with the highest number of TB cases which cover two-thirds of all global TB cases, namely India (26%), Indonesia (8.5%), China (8.4%), Philippines (6%), Pakistan (5.7%), Nigeria (4.4%), Bangladesh (3.6%), and South Africa (3.6%). As many as 8.2% of TB cases are HIV positive. In 2019, an estimated 3.3% of new cases of Pulmonary TB and 18% of Pulmonary TB with a history of previous TB treatment were multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant TB (MDR/RR TB) with an absolute number of 465,000 (400,000 - 535,000) new cases of MDR/RR TB.4.'}","{'id': 'chunk-f774010b35b34852a2c519ed5635f92d', 'content': '103\nGENERAL DERMATOLOGY\n Porphyria \n Inherited or acquired disorders due to enzyme • \ndeﬁ ciency causing ↑ production of porphyrins \n(photosensitizing) or their precursors during \nheme synthesis \n Porphyrins (uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, protoporphyrin) absorb light \nintensely in the Soret band (400–410 nm) → reactive oxygen species \nwith subsequent damage to skin, liver, and/or rbcs \n Table 3-14 Types of Porphyria \n Inheritance/Defect Labs Description Treatment \n Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria ( CEP) (Gunther’s disease) \n AR \n Uroporphyrinogen III \ncosynthase \n Urine: ++ uro/copro Extreme photosensitivity \n(bullae with subsequent \nmutilated scarring), hypertrichosis, \n erythrodontia (red ﬂ uorescent \nteeth), hemolysis, red urine (stains \ndiapers), ↑ risk skin CA \n Light avoidance, \ntransfusions for anemia, \n± bone marrow trans-\nplantation (BMT), \n± splenectomy \n Stool: ++ copro \n RBC: + uro \n Plasma: + ﬂ uoresce \n Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP) \n AD \n Ferrochelatase \n Urine: normal levels Photosensitivity with burning, \nheals with waxy scars, porphyrin \n gallstones , hepatic damage \n Light avoidance, oral \nb -carotene, monitor \nliver Stool: ++ proto \n RBC: ++ proto \n Plasma: ± ﬂ uoresce \n Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT) \n AD (familial form) \nor acquired \n Urine: ++ uro > copro \n Stool: + isocopro \n RBC: normal levels \n Tense bullae, erosions, milia \nand scarring on sun-exposed skin, \nhypertrichosis (temples), iron \noverload, scleroderma-like \nchanges, facial hyperpigmentation \n Phlebotomy every \n2 weeks, oral \nantimalarial agent Uroporphyrinogen \ndecarboxylase (UD) \n Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP) \n AD Urine: + ALA, PBG, NO skin ﬁ ndings; neurologic \nand psychiatric ﬁ ndings \nw/ ↑ abdominal pain \n Remove trigger, glucose \nloading, hematin \ninfusion Porphobilinogen \ndeaminase (PBD) \n Stool/RBC/plasma: \nall normal levels \n Variegate Porphyria (VP) \n AD Urine: + ALA/PBG Overlap between AIP \nand PCT \n Same treatment for AIP \nduring acute attacks Protoporphyrinogen \noxidase (PPO) \n Stool: + proto, copro \n Plasma: + ﬂ uoresce \n Hereditary Coproporphyria \n AD Urine: ALA, PBG, Acute attacks similar to mild \nversion of AIP; may have skin \nﬁ ndings (mimics PCT) \n Same as variegate \nprophyria Coproporphyrinogen \noxidase (CPO) \n Stool: + copro, proto \n RBC: normal level \n Hepatoerythropoietic Porphyria \n AR Urine: + uro Overlap between PCT \nand CEP \n Photoprotection \n(phlebotomy NOT \neffective) Uroporphyrinogen \ndecarboxylase \n Stool: + uro, copro \nRBC: + proto \n Uro : uroporphyrinogen Copro : coproporphyrinogen Isocopro : isocoproporphyrinogen \n Proto : protoporphyrinogen ALA : aminolevulinic acid PBG: porphobilinogen \n CEP: C olorless (anemia), E rythrodontia, P hotosensitivity \n UTC (uro three cosynthase): U r T eeth r C olored \n E PP: enzyme starts with F \n PCT – UD : U rine D azzles pink \n(ﬂ uoresce with Wood’s light) Triggers: alcohol, HCV , estrogen, polychlorinated hydrocar-\nbons, iron overload ( hemochromatosis , C282Y gene), HIV \n Triggers: drugs (barbiturates), stress, fasting, \nalcohol, hormonal changes, infections \n AIP-PBD: A bdomen I s P ainful, \n P lease B arbiturates D /C \n VP-PPO: V i P s have P ink P lasma O ptimized at 626 nm ( ﬂ uoresces ) .'}","{'id': 'chunk-793436ec31db44c98811852eaad83caa', 'content': '- 27 - poles so that they are easy to identify (Table 1.)

Currently, surgical masks and respirators should be discarded after use for such patient care. Entry of HCWs into isolation rooms Other issues to consider when making assumption planning include the expected frequency of HCWs entering the isolation room, whether a PPE will be reused by the same HCW during a work shift, and how many HCWs will enter the isolation room. All of these factors are directly related to how much PPE will be used. The number of HCWs entering the isolation room and the frequency of each HCW’s entry should be limited to the minimum necessary for patient care. To reduce the number of HCWs entering the isolation room, tasks should be performed by as few HCWs as possible. Another way to reduce the frequency of HCWs entering the isolation room is to provide a means of communication between the patient/patient’s family in the treatment room and HCWs outside the treatment room via telephone or other means. Patient pooling may reduce the need for PPE because some patients must be seen without the HCW leaving the isolation room. It should also be anticipated that HCWs providing care to patients with ARI of potential concern will require PPE breaks, as wearing PPE makes the body hot and tired, and these factors can lead to infection prevention and control breaches. Assumptions about factors such as these should be incorporated into a mathematical model used to estimate the amount of PPE needed. For example: n Number of ARI epidemic/pandemic patients per day for an average of X days. n Number of HCWs entering the isolation room per work shift; length of shift. n Number of HCWs having direct contact with epidemic/pandemic patients per day.'}","{'id': 'chunk-33aa36acdb45414198e9efa84c420c5c', 'content': 'Page 351 / 407\nNecrotising infections of the skin and softtissues\nInvasive infections of the soft tissues: skin, subcutaneous tissue, superﬁcial or deep fascia, muscles.
