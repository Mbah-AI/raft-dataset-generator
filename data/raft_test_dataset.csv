Diazepam is rarely used in neonates because it has very severe side effects such as central nervous system and respiratory depression (apnea/hypoventilation), and vascular collapse. The risk of administering diazepam followed by intravenous phenobarbital can worsen the effects of central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory depression. Therapeutic doses of diazepam in neonates vary widely and sometimes reach toxic doses that cause respiratory arrest. In addition, the rapid clearance of diazepam in the brain (several minutes after an intravenous dose) means that this drug cannot be used as maintenance therapy.

One type of bacteria can use one or more of these mechanisms to overcome the intestinal mucosal defense.2-4 DIAGNOSIS General Approach to Acute Bacterial Diarrhea Diagnosis of patients with acute bacterial diarrhea requires a systematic and careful examination.

This sequence has advantages because the imaging matrix is larger, the sections are thinner, and there is minimal susceptibility to artifacts. Foer, et al conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the benefits of non-EPI DW in detecting residual cholesteatoma in patients after canal wall-up mastoidectomy, compared with second-look surgery findings and obtained a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 100%, NPP of 100%, and NPN of 90%.33 These results are also supported by research by Garrido L, et al who found that the sensitivity, specificity, NPP, and NPN of non-EPI DW MRI in detecting recurrent cholesteatoma were 100%, 66.7%, 90.9%, and 100%.

Special measures are the placement of patients with the same presumed diagnosis (same epidemiological and clinical information) in the same unit, but whose causative agent has not been confirmed by laboratory testing.

Airborne transmission can be further categorized into “obligate” transmission or “preferential” transmission (5). Obligate airborne transmission is the transmission of pathogens only through the deposition of droplet nuclei under natural conditions (e.g., pulmonary tuberculosis). Preferential airborne transmission is the transmission of pathogens that can cause infection through many routes, but the most common route is via droplet nuclei (e.g., measles, chickenpox).

Determining the safe or dangerous type of OMSK and assessing the presence or absence of complications is important to be done early on to determine further management. Supporting examinations are adjusted to the patient&#39;s signs and symptoms, including hearing function, balance, facial nerves, and imaging.

A normal Rinne (air conduction better than bone conduction) doesn't definitively rule out hearing loss, as some studies have shown a likelihood ratio for hearing loss even with normal results. This limitation underscores the importance of combining the Rinne with other tests like Weber and Bing for a more comprehensive evaluation.  For instance, a patient might have a normal Rinne test but lateralize to one side on the Weber test, suggesting sensorineural loss on the contralateral side. Similarly, a negative Bing test, indicating conductive loss, would further refine the diagnosis even with a normal Rinne.  Therefore, while a normal Rinne may suggest that conductive hearing loss is less likely, it should not be interpreted in isolation.  The combined interpretation of all three tests helps overcome the limitations of individual tests and improves diagnostic accuracy.  As discussed in the provided references, the likelihood ratio for hearing loss with an abnormal Rinne test varies widely but is mostly greater than 15, whereas a normal Rinne still has a likelihood ratio between 0.01 and 0.85, making the combination with the Weber and Bing tests crucial for initial assessment and guiding further diagnostic steps.",POSITIVE_2

The lower limit of hemoglobin and hematocrit values by WHO are shown in Table 2. In infants less than six months, low hemoglobin levels are caused by physiological anemia but are not expected to be below 9 mg/dL. [5] WHO classifies anemia into mild, moderate, and severe anemia as shown in Table 3. [30] When the amount of hemoglobin in a red blood cell is reduced, the red blood cells will be smaller and paler. This is manifested by a decrease in the mean erythrocyte volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). In the peripheral blood smear, red blood cells appear microcytic and hypochromic. The MCV and MCH are parallel to each other; meaning that microcytic red blood cells will also be hypochromic. Laboratory findings in children with iron deficiency are shown in Table 4. [5] Table 2.

In addition, parasitic infections also contribute to iron deficiency, especially in developing countries.[5] 3. EPIDEMIOLOGY WHO reported that the prevalence of anemia in infants and children (6-59 months) in America in 2011 was 6%. [14] Based on data from 2010, the prevalence of anemia in low-income populations increased from 13.4% in 2001 to 14.6% in 2010. The highest prevalence of anemia was found in children aged 12–17 months.[15,16] Several risk factors for anemia found in children are age 6–23 months, living in urban areas, mothers without formal education, mothers with an education level equivalent to primary education, monthly family income &lt; 750 ETB, family income 750–1500 ETB, initiation of complementary foods for breast milk under six months, and underweight.[17] Prematurity, history of exclusive breastfeeding without iron-fortified diet intake after six months, introduction of cow&#39;s milk at an age earlier than one year, low socioeconomic status, dietary restrictions on vegetarians, diarrhea and chronic diseases are also risk factors for iron deficiency anemia.[18,19] 4. CLINICAL FINDINGS Most infants and children with mild anemia do not show severe clinical symptoms and signs. The preliminary evaluation that needs to be done includes a history of the disease such as a history of premature birth, low birth weight, diet, chronic diseases, and a family history of anemia. In addition, it is necessary to ask about risk factors for iron deficiency anemia such as low birth weight, history of prematurity, exposure to heavy metals, history of exclusive breastfeeding for more than four months, and diet without iron fortification in children.[20] The CDC recommends early detection of iron deficiency anemia in children aged 9-12 months in the lower middle class. In addition, early detection in premature and low birth weight infants before the age of six months if the infant is not given an iron-fortified diet.[21] A complete blood count is the first laboratory test performed to evaluate anemia and allows differentiation of microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias based on mean corpuscular volume.[1] In iron deficiency anemia, as with other anemia diagnoses, laboratory tests may be performed if there are no clinical symptoms. Progressive and gradual pallor may go unnoticed by the patient&#39;s family. The most prominent research finding in iron deficiency anemia is its effects on the neurocognitive system. Many prospective studies have found that retardation occurs.'}",[],0,"I'm sorry, Mbah-AI can't answer that question. Is there anything else that I can help?

Principles and design of natural ventilation B.1 Principles of natural ventilation Two ways of producing natural ventilation: wind pressure and stack pressure (188).\nWind pressure When wind strikes a building, it exerts positive pressure on the windward surfaces and negative pressure on the leeward surfaces. This causes air to flow through the windward openings in the building to the low-pressure openings on the leeward sides (Figure 5). The wind pressure for a simple building can be estimated (189). For simple buildings, data obtained from wind tunnel testing can be used directly. For complex buildings, wind tunnel testing or (188) computational influenza dynamics (190) may be required. Figure 5. Direction of wind-induced airflow in a building (189) For one-sided ventilation, as shown in Figure 6, there is no effect of the mean wind pressure, but only of its fluctuating components. Therefore, the resulting ventilation flow rate may be much lower than the ventilation flow rate that can be achieved with cross ventilation. This one-sided ventilation design, which is the most common design seen in hospitals, cannot create a pressure gradient to produce a constant airflow through the building, but it can create pressure fluctuations and turbulent flow. This condition can be improved by installing ventilation holes or exhaust fans to increase ACH (189).Figure 6.

A higher delta-P indicates more resistance to airflow and could make breathing more difficult.  Additionally, if the mask material has poor filtration efficiency, it might necessitate a tighter fit, further exacerbating breathing difficulties. Relevant standards for evaluating surgical masks include ASTM F 1862-00a for fluid resistance, ASTM F 2101-01 for bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE), and information on biocompatibility can be found at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/094.html. While these standards primarily address safety and performance, they indirectly relate to comfort as masks failing these standards might require design modifications that impact breathability.  Separate from the mask itself, the ventilation system of the healthcare facility can also influence a patient's breathing comfort. Poorly designed natural ventilation systems, particularly those relying on one-sided wind pressure, can result in turbulent airflow and pressure fluctuations within the room, potentially compounding breathing difficulties for the patient wearing a mask.  Improving air changes per hour (ACH) through better ventilation design, including the use of exhaust fans or strategically placed openings, can help alleviate this issue.",POSITIVE_2

It usually responds to\ncorticosteroids.\nSecondary NS is associated with infectious diseases (e.g. post-infectious glomerulonephritis, endocarditis, hepatitis B\nand C, HIV infection, malaria, and schistosomiasis) and may respond to treatment of the underlying cause.\xa0Children with NS are at increased risk of thromboembolism, severe bacterial infections (in particular, due to\xa0S.\npneumoniae) and malnutrition.

Upon awaking, the child has periorbital or facial oedema, which over the day decreases as oedema of the\nlegs increases.\nThis oedema should be differentiated from the oedema of severe acute malnutrition (SAM): in SAM, the child\npresents with bilateral pitting oedema of the feet and lower legs that does not vary with position. Oedema extends\nupwards to hands and face in severe cases. It is usually associated with typical skin and hair changes (see\nKwashiorkor:\xa0Severe acute malnutrition, Chapter 1).\nOnce SAM is excluded, the following two criteria must be met to make a clinical diagnosis of primary NS:\nPresence of heavy proteinuria,\nand\nAbsence of associated infections: see Hepatitis B and C and HIV infection (Chapter 8), Malaria and\nSchistosomiases (Chapter 6).\nUrine\nMeasure protein with urinary dipstick on three separate voided urine samples (ﬁrst voided urine if possible).

However, the persistent fever warrants further investigation.  Key diagnostic considerations include:

* **Primary NS:** This is the most common cause in children 1-10 years and typically responds to corticosteroids.  The diagnosis requires heavy proteinuria and the *absence* of associated infections.
* **Secondary NS:** This can be caused by infections like malaria, schistosomiasis, HIV, hepatitis B and C, or post-infectious glomerulonephritis.  Treatment focuses on the underlying cause.
* **Infection as the primary cause:**  The fever suggests an infectious process might be driving the symptoms.  ENT infections, urinary tract infections, TB, skin infections, and even meningitis should be considered.  The presence of oedema might even point towards severe acute malnutrition (SAM) with a concurrent infection.

Management:

1. **Rule out SAM:** Assess for skin and hair changes characteristic of SAM. If suspected, manage accordingly.
2. **Confirm heavy proteinuria:** Perform urine dipstick tests on three separate occasions.
3. **Investigate for infections:**  In endemic areas, check for malaria.  Consider a lumbar puncture if meningitis is suspected.  Perform chest x-ray, CBC, blood cultures, urinalysis, and stool culture as needed.  If TB is suspected, investigate for AFB.
4. **Exclude secondary causes:**  Conduct tests for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and other potential underlying infections or conditions.
5. **Treat underlying infections:** If an infection is identified (e.g., UTI, pneumonia), treat it promptly. Do not routinely give prophylactic antibiotics in NS.
6. **Manage primary NS:** If primary NS is diagnosed, initiate corticosteroid treatment (prednisolone or prednisone) after ruling out or treating active infections. Ensure the child receives appropriate vaccinations.
7. **Address complications:** Monitor for and manage complications like thromboembolism, infections (especially *S. pneumoniae*), and malnutrition.  Restrict salt intake but do not restrict fluids unless oedema is severe.  Encourage mobility to prevent thromboembolism.
8. **Follow-up:** Monitor the child closely, at least monthly, checking weight and urine protein at each visit.",POSITIVE_5

The STHs that are abundant in Indonesia are roundworms (Ascaris lumbricoides), whipworms (Trichuris trichiura) and hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus).\nRoundworm, whipworm and hookworm infections are closely related to the habit of defecating carelessly, not washing hands before eating and children playing on the ground without wearing shoes and the habit of eating soil (geophagia). The habit of defecating carelessly causes the soil to be contaminated with worm eggs. In general, worm eggs survive in moist soil and then develop into infective eggs. Infective worm eggs in the soil can be swallowed into the human digestive system if hands are not washed before eating and Worm infections can also occur through worm larvae that penetrate the skin..'}","{'id': 'chunk-109ef5eec3cc4703aa25d4542981b0ab', 'content': 'The eggs of roundworms (A. lumbricoides) and whipworms (T. trichiura) in their life cycle require clay and a warm and moist environment to develop into the infective form.

The more eggs are found in the source of contamination (soil, dust, vegetables, etc.), the higher the endemicity in an area..In plantation and mining areas, hookworm infections often occur in residents living around them. Hookworms in their transmission cycle require loose sandy soil, mixed with humus, and protected from direct sunlight.

In most infants, bilirubin levels decrease on the 4th day, but in breast-milk jaundice, bilirubin continues to rise, even reaching 20-30 mg/dL at 14 days of age.

Which is accompanied by good weight gain, normal liver function, and no evidence of hemolysis. Breast-milk jaundice can recur (70%) in subsequent pregnancies. The actual mechanism that causes breast-milk jaundice is not yet known, but it is thought to arise due to inhibition of uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid glucuronyl transferase (UDGPA) by the product of progesterone metabolism, namely pregnane-3-alpha 2-beta-diol, which is found in the breast milk of some mothers..'}","{'id': 'chunk-4a2bb3203c3c43649daef2a463e8631c', 'content': 'Bilirubin bound to serum albumin is a non-polar substance and is not soluble in water and will then be transported to liver cells.

In the case report, no infants required respiratory assistance even though there was stupor and an orogastric tube was required..\nGiven the availability of anti-seizure drugs in health facilities in Indonesia and the competence of medical personnel in remote areas, the recommendation for diazepam use in Indonesia is as follows: if diazepam must be used, the main choice is a continuous infusion (drip) of diazepam to prevent the undesirable effects mentioned above. However, if there is no expert who can install peripheral or umbilical intravenous access, then diazepam can be given rectally (suppository form (5 mg/2.5 mL) using a 1 mL syringe connected to a short-cut orogastric tube (see Figure 21.) at a dose of 0.5 mg/kgBW.

Bronchogenic spread occurs when bacteria spread through the airways, either to other parts of the affected lung or to the contralateral lung. Swallowing infected sputum can also lead to spread within the gastrointestinal tract.

Systemic spread occurs primarily through the lymphatic and hematogenous routes.  Initially, M. tuberculosis spreads through the pulmonary lymphatics to regional lymph nodes, triggering further immune responses and potentially causing lymphadenitis. From the lymph nodes, especially via the thoracic duct, bacteria can enter the bloodstream, resulting in hematogenous dissemination. This can lead to the development of miliary tuberculosis (widespread dissemination to multiple organs), tuberculosis meningitis, and Landouzy typhobacillosis.

Bilirubin, however, is lipophilic and insoluble in water at physiological pH.  This insolubility means it requires transport mechanisms and conjugation for excretion. In newborns, the immature liver struggles with efficient bilirubin conjugation and excretion, leading to a buildup of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood, which is a primary cause of neonatal jaundice.

Respiratory protection A.1 High-risk aerosol-generating procedures Aerosols are produced when an air stream moves across the surface of a liquid film, generating small particles at the interface between the air and the liquid. The particle size is inversely proportional to the air velocity. Therefore, when a procedure causes air to move at high speed over the respiratory mucosa and epithelium, there is a risk of generating small aerosols (e.g., droplet nuclei). An aerosol-generating procedure is defined as any procedure performed on a patient that can generate aerosols of any size, including droplet nuclei. Several medical procedures have been reported to generate aerosols (71, 72, 100, 107, 143, 168-178), and some have been associated with an increased risk of pathogen transmission (Table 6) (71, 72, 100, 107, 130, 143, 168, 169, 171, 172, 174-182). Many of these studies have significant methodological weaknesses that preclude recommendations from these studies. In fact, the risks associated with many aerosol-generating procedures are not fully understood, and our understanding of the aerobiology of aerosol-generating procedures is likely to change and evolve as research continues in this area. Table 6 presents a selection of studies that have examined the risk of infection associated with these procedures. In these guidelines, the term “aerosol-generating procedures associated with a proven increased risk of pathogen transmission” refers to the following procedures performed on patients with ARI: n intubation and related procedures (e.g., manual ventilation, suctioning) (71, 72, 169); n cardiopulmonary resuscitation (169); n bronchoscopy (174, 175); n surgery and autopsy (130, 178).'}",['chunk-a2eac47080e749b0815b61f34b467f3f'],1,Cardiovascular CT and MRI scans are used to confirm the anatomy of the aortic arch in cases of suspected CoA.,POSITIVE_1

The pathogenesis of otogenic brain abscess can occur due to expansion from the ear or more often due to hematogenous processes, therefore even though culture has limited diagnostic capabilities, blood culture should always be taken before starting empirical therapy for otogenic brain abscess..Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing is recommended, especially if there are risk factors..\nThe recommended imaging for the diagnosis of brain abscess is MRI with contrast and diffusion-weighted images.

The most common causes of iron deficiency anemia in children are inadequate intake accompanied by rapid growth, low birth weight, and gastrointestinal losses, for example due to excessive consumption of cow&#39;s milk. The most common clinical manifestation of iron deficiency is anemia. In mild anemia, most infants and children do not show severe clinical symptoms and signs. Based on WHO data in 2011 published by WHO in 2015, there were 273.2 million (95% CI: 241.8 - 303.7) children with anemia. Summary: Diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia involves clinical and laboratory examinations that include peripheral blood, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and serum iron. Early detection is needed because iron deficiency can occur before signs of anemia are found. The most commonly used early detection of iron deficiency is serum ferritin with a threshold that varies depending on age. Management of iron deficiency anemia in children involves changing high iron nutrition and giving iron preparations at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg/day in 2-3 divided doses. Key Message: Efforts to prevent and treat iron deficiency anemia are important so that children&#39;s growth and development can be optimal according to their age..'}","{'id': 'chunk-1b89e728cc8b4c6783faa11809e51a55', 'content': '339\nLIFE AFTER BOARDS\n CCI versions are updated quarterly (January, April, July, and October) \x81 \n When looking at the CCI table, there will be either a 0 or 1 next to the CPT code, which is the indicator code for the \x81 \nassociated CPT code relaying if a particular modiﬁ er will indeed override the computer edit and result in reimbursement;

Planning for preparedness of health-care facilities for ARI epidemics The recent SARS outbreak and the threat of an influenza pandemic have demonstrated the importance of preparedness for infectious disease. Health-care facilities should prepare for infectious disease emergencies by (144-147): n organizing permanent infection prevention and control activities, surveillance, and training of specialized personnel and clinical staff; n establishing a multidisciplinary health-care facility group to develop a preparedness plan; n developing a health-care facility preparedness plan; n conducting plan evaluations, monitoring exercises, and updates; and n strengthening linkages with relevant levels of the health-care/non-health-care system. Rationale If early prevention of a novel respiratory virus with epidemic/pandemic potential fails, and given that most people are not immune to the pathogen, a significant proportion of the population, including health-care workers, may become ill and require different levels of health-care services. This will pose challenges in patient management and in preventing health-care-associated transmission risks. Health care facility preparedness is considered an essential part of a general pandemic preparedness plan (148, 149). Its primary objectives are to: n identify, isolate, and report early cases of ARD viruses that are likely to become epidemic/pandemic; n maintain the health care system capable of serving pandemic or non-pandemic patients; and n reduce the risk of health care-associated transmission of pandemic ARD. The ability of health care facilities to respond efficiently to an epidemic or pandemic threat is highly dependent on the standards of care in place. Implementing additional measures during an outbreak is challenging, and the absence of effective standards of care can hamper epidemic/pandemic response efforts. Thus, preparedness to respond to the threat of an ARD pandemic lies in enhancing the capacity for continuous early detection of episodes and safe care in health care facilities. Promotion of Standard Precautions Routine health care practices are the foundation for reducing the spread of pathogens and should be enhanced worldwide to help health care facilities prepare for a potential pandemic. VI.1 Health care facility preparedness plan for ARD pandemic A health care facility preparedness plan for ARD pandemic should take into account the geographic location of the health care facility and the development of the pandemic and include actions to be taken before, during, and after a pandemic.

The indicators used are the achievement of the following targets by 2030: 1. The number of deaths due to TB is reduced by 95% compared to 2015 2. The incidence of TB is reduced by 90% compared to 2015 3. No family experiences catastrophic economic problems The pillars and components of the end TB strategy are: 1. Integrated patient-centered management and prevention efforts, 2. Strong political support and support systems 3. Intensification of research and new innovations.Integrated patient-centered management and prevention efforts components are implemented in the form of: 1. Early diagnosis of TB including the implementation of universal drug sensitivity testing, systematic screening of contacts and high-risk groups..'}",[],0,"I'm sorry, Mbah-AI can't answer that question.

DEFINITION Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex..\nD. MORPHOLOGY AND STRUCTURE Mycobacterium tuberculosis is shaped like a straight or slightly curved rod, without spores and without a capsule. This bacterium is 0.3 – 0.6 \uf06dm wide and 1 – 4 \uf06dm long. The M.\ntuberculosis is very complex, consisting of a fairly high fat layer (60%). The main components of the M. tuberculosis cell wall are mycolic acid, complex waxes, trehalose dimycolate called cord factor, and mycobacterial sulfolipids which play a role in virulence. Mycolic acid is a long-chain fatty acid (C60 - C90) which is connected to arabinogalactan by glycolipid bonds and to peptidoglycan by phosphodiester bridges. Other elements found in the bacterial cell wall are polysaccharides such as arabinogalactan and arabinomannan. The complex cell wall structure causes M. tuberculosis to be acid-resistant, that is, if once stained it will remain resistant to attempts to remove the dye with an acid-alcohol solution. Based on these unique characteristics, bacteria from the genus Mycobacterium are often referred to as Acid-Fast Bacteria (AFB) or acid-fast bacilli (AFB)..The M. tuberculosis genome consists of 4.41 Mb (mega base) base pairs and contains 4,009 genes. The uniqueness of the M. tuberculosis genome compared to other bacterial genomes is the large number of genes involved in the processes of lipogenesis and lipolysis.

However, additional precautions like droplet, airborne, or contact precautions are necessary depending on the specific infection. For instance, airborne precautions may be needed for infections like measles or tuberculosis, while droplet precautions are appropriate for influenza.

Iron preparations in ferric form must be converted to ferrous in order to be absorbed. The most commonly used ferrous salt preparations include ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous fumarate, and ferrous succinate.[45] Ferrous sulfate is still the most commonly used preparation. Absorption of ferrous sulfate is very good and its bioavailability is high, but its side effects include gastrointestinal irritation, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain. [5] The latest randomized clinical trial study showed that therapy of anemia deficiency in children with ferrous ascorbate (FA) or iron polymaltose complex (IPC) was proven to improve hematological parameters including hemoglobin, MCV, RDW, and reticulocytes. Therapy with FA or IPC was given for 3-4 months with a dose of 6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron divided into 2-3 doses.[46,47] The increase in hemoglobin after 3 months of therapy was 4.88 ± 1.28 in the FA group compared to 3.33 ± 1.33 in the IPC group. In addition, the increase in MCV values in the FA group one month after therapy was 9.80 ± 8.56 and in the IPC group was 5.35 ± 6.11.[48] Clinical trial study by Powers JM, et al. stated that giving 3 mg/kg of elemental iron once a day in the form of ferrous sulfate for 12 weeks was more effective in increasing hemoglobin levels compared to iron polysaccharide complexes in children aged 9–48 months with iron deficiency anemia. [49] Therapy will have an impact both clinically and in the laboratory. Signs and symptoms in patients such as restlessness, decreased appetite, and fatigue quickly disappear when therapy is started. The increase in reticulocyte count increases on days 7–19 of therapy. If the diagnosis of deficiency anemia is correct, there will be an increase in Hb of 1 g/dL or more after 10 days since therapy was started. If this happens, therapy can be continued for up to two months later to meet iron reserves.'}","{'id': 'chunk-48800a16668f45daa2fc26e76dfbf3e4', 'content': '6 CHAPTER III DIAGNOSIS OF MALARIA The clinical manifestations of malaria can vary from mild to life-threatening.

Use of disinfectants: alcohol and bleach Different countries have different disinfection procedures. Health-care facilities with limited resources may not have some types of hospital disinfectants. Alcohol and bleach are acceptable chemical disinfectants when used correctly. As with other disinfectants, soiled surfaces should be cleaned with water and detergent before applying alcohol or bleach. Alcohol Alcohol is effective against influenza viruses (229). Ethyl alcohol (70%) is an effective broad-spectrum germicide and is generally considered superior to isopropyl alcohol. Alcohol is often used to disinfect small surfaces (e.g., rubber stoppers of multi-dose medication bottles, and thermometers) and occasionally the external surfaces of equipment (e.g., stethoscopes and ventilators). Because alcohol is flammable, its use as a surface disinfectant should be limited to small surfaces and should only be used in well-ventilated areas. Alcohols can also cause discoloration, swelling, hardening, and cracking of rubber and certain plastics after prolonged, repeated use. Sodium hypochlorite (bleach) Bleach is a powerful and effective disinfectant, but it is easily inactivated in the presence of organic matter. The active ingredient, sodium hypochlorite, is effective at killing bacteria, fungi, and viruses, including influenza viruses. Diluted household bleach disinfects within a contact time of 10–60 minutes (see Table 7 for concentrations and contact times), is readily available and inexpensive, and can be recommended for surface disinfection in health care facilities. However, bleach is damaging to mucous membranes, skin, and the respiratory tract, decomposes on exposure to heat and light, and reacts readily with other chemicals. Therefore, caution is required when using bleach. Ventilation should be adequate and in accordance with applicable occupational safety and health guidelines. Improper use of bleach, including deviation from recommended dilution (more concentrated or less diluted), can reduce its disinfection effectiveness and may result in injury to health care workers. Procedure for preparing/using diluted bleach n Wear a mask, rubber gloves, and a waterproof apron.

A definitive diagnosis is made by identifying AFB in the CSF (though sensitivity is low), a positive TCM MTB/RIF test on the CSF, or growth of M. tuberculosis in CSF culture.

Patients diagnosed with hearing loss due to CSOM were known to be 108 subjects. There was a difference in the mean pure tone audiometry threshold between CSOM patients and normal subjects (p&lt;0.05).\nA systematic review by Blom EF, et al studied the relationship between preoperative ossicular damage and postoperative hearing status of patients. Hearing status assessment was performed using the Austin-Kartush classification which was divided into 6 groups, namely group A if the malleus and stapes were intact, B if only the malleus was intact, C if only the stapes was intact, D if both were not intact, E if there was malleus head fixation, and F if there was stapes fixation. Of the 5661 articles, only 9 retrospective cohort studies that had high relevance with the results of data pooling showed a significant difference (p&lt;0.001) in the average air-bone gap (ABG) of group B [11.1(95% CI, 10.3-11.8)] and group C [15.7(95% CI, 14.6-16.7)], and between group B and group D [16.5(95% CI, 15.2-17.9)]. Meanwhile, three other studies showed that there was no significant difference in postoperative ABG between patients with and without intact stapes structure. Thus, malleus status is a significant predictor of postoperative hearing outcome, regardless of the condition of the stapes..c.

Although mortality is known to be decreasing along with the use of antibiotics and proper management, deaths due to complications of OMSK are still found.

The\ninfection is noncontagious.\nClostridium tetani\xa0is introduced into the body through a wound and produces a toxin whose action on the central\nnervous system is responsible for the symptoms of tetanus.\nTetanus is entirely preventable by vaccination. It occurs in people who have not been fully vaccinated before exposure\nor have not received adequate post-exposure prophylaxis. In these individuals, most breaks in the skin or mucous\nmembranes carry a risk of tetanus, but the wounds with the greatest risk are: the stump of the umbilical cord in\nneonates, puncture wounds, wounds with tissue loss or contamination with foreign material or soil, avulsion and crush\ninjuries, sites of non-sterile injections, chronic wounds (e.g. lower extremity ulcers), burns and bites. Surgical or\nobstetrical procedures performed under non-sterile conditions also carry a risk of tetanus.\nClinical features\nGeneralised tetanus is the most frequent and severe form of the infection. It presents as muscular rigidity, which\nprogresses rapidly to involve the entire body, and muscle spasms, which are very painful. Level of consciousness is not\naltered.\nChildren and adults\nNeonates\nTreatment\nHospitalisation is needed and usually lasts 3 to 4 weeks. Correct management can reduce mortality even in hospitals\nwith limited resources.\nGeneral measures\nAverage time from exposure to onset of symptoms is 7 days (3 to 21 days).\nMuscular rigidity begins in the jaw muscles (difﬁculty with then inability to open mouth [trismus] preventing the patient\nfrom speaking, eating), spreading to the face (ﬁxed smile), neck (difﬁculty with swallowing), to the trunk (restriction\nof respiratory muscles; hyperextension of spine [opisthotonus]), to the abdomen (guarding) and to the limbs (ﬂexion\nof the upper limbs and extension of the lower limbs).\nMuscle spasms, which are very painful, appear at the onset or when muscular rigidity becomes generalised. They\nare triggered by stimuli (noise, light, touch) or arise spontaneously. Spasms of the thoracic and laryngeal muscles\nmay cause respiratory distress or aspiration.\nIn 90% of cases, initial symptoms appear within 3 to 14 days of birth.\nThe ﬁrst signs are signiﬁcant irritability and difﬁculty sucking (rigidity of the lips, trismus) then rigidity becomes\ngeneralised, as in adults. Any neonate, who initially sucked and cried normally, presenting with irritability and difﬁculty\nsucking 3 to 28 days after birth and demonstrating rigidity and muscle spasms should be assumed to have neonatal\ntetanus.\nEnsure intensive nursing care.\nThe patient should be in a dark, quiet room.

This decrease will stimulate the respiratory center, so that the breathing rate is faster and deeper (Kussmaul). This reaction is the body&#39;s attempt to excrete carbonic acid so that the pH can return to normal. In a state of uncompensated metabolic acidosis, standard bicarbonate is also low, pCO2 is normal, and base excess is very negative.2-4 Cardiovascular disorders in severe hypovolemia can be in the form of shock with signs of rapid pulse, blood pressure decreases to the point of being unmeasurable. Patients begin to feel restless, their faces are pale, their extremities are cold, and sometimes cyanotic. Loss of potassium can also cause cardiac arrhythmias.2-4 Decreased blood pressure will cause decreased renal perfusion and anuria will occur; if not treated immediately, complications will arise in the form of acute renal tubular necrosis, which means acute renal failure. If metabolic acidosis becomes more severe, pulmonary circulation will be centralized and can cause pulmonary edema in patients receiving intravenous fluid rehydration without alkali.2-4 Laboratory Examination Laboratory evaluation of patients suspected of infectious diarrhea begins with stool examination. Stool usually does not contain leukocytes, if present, it is considered a marker of colonic inflammation, both infectious and non-infectious. The sample should be examined as soon as possible because neutrophils change rapidly. The sensitivity of fecal leukocytes to inflammatory pathogens (Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter) detected by stool culture varies from 45% - 95% depending on the type of pathogen.2-4 A more stable marker for intestinal inflammation is lactoferrin. Lactoferrin is an iron-coated glycoprotein released by neutrophils, its presence in the stool indicates colonic inflammation. False positives can occur in breastfed infants. In one study, fecal lactoferrin was detected using a commercial latex agglutination test, the sensitivity was 83-93% and the specificity was 61-100% against Salmonella, Campylobacter, or Shigella spp, detected from stool culture.2-4 Stool culture should be performed in every patient suspected or suffering from inflammatory diarrhea based on clinical and epidemiological, positive stool leukocyte or lactoferrin examination, or both. In bloody diarrhea, stool culture should be performed for EHEC O157: H7.2-4 In patients with severe diarrhea with fever, abdominal pain, or fluid loss, blood chemistry, sodium, potassium, chloride, urea, creatinine, blood gas analysis, and complete blood count should be checked.2-4 Radiological examinations, such as sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy and others, are usually not helpful in evaluating acute infectious diarrhea.2-4 Some Causes of Acute Bacterial Infectious Diarrhea a. Non-invasive infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Vibrio cholerae, pathogenic Escherichia coli. b. Invasive infections: Shigella, Salmonella nontyphoid, Salmonella typhi, Campylobacter, Vibrio non-cholera, Yersinia, Entero- hemorrhagic E. coli (subtype 0157), Aeromonas, Plesiomonas. Approach to adult patients with acute diarrhea:3 1. Perform initial assessment. 2. Treat dehydration. 3. Prevent dehydration in patients without signs of dehydration using fluids or oral rehydration solutions: a) Rehydrate patients with moderate dehydration using oral rehydration solutions and correct severe dehydration with appropriate intravenous solutions, b) Provide hydration using oral rehydration solutions, c) Treat symptoms. 4. Management stratification: a) Epidemiological clues: food, antibiotics, sexual activity, travel, other diseases, epidemics, season. b) Clinical clues: bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, dysentery, weight loss, fecal inﬂammation. 5. Collecting fecal specimens for analysis: If diarrhea is severe, inﬂammatory, bloody or persistent, and at the beginning of an outbreak or epidemic. 6. Considering antimicrobial therapy for speciﬁc pathogens. MANAGEMENT A. FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE REPLACEMENT The most important aspect is to maintain adequate hydration and electrolyte balance during the acute episode. This is done by oral rehydration, which should be performed on all patients, unless they are unable to drink or have severe life-threatening diarrhea requiring intravenous hydration. Ideally, an oral rehydration solution should consist of 3.5 grams of sodium chloride, 2.5 grams of sodium bicarbonate, 1.5 grams of potassium chloride, and 20 grams of glucose per liter of water. Such solutions are commercially available in packets that are easy to prepare by mixing with water.

These dormant bacilli are not actively replicating and do not cause symptoms, but they can reactivate later in life if the immune system weakens, leading to active TB disease.  Therefore, primary TB infection can progress to either latent TB infection or active TB disease, depending on the host's immune response and other factors.",POSITIVE_2

Use of disinfectants: alcohol and bleach Different countries have different disinfection procedures. Health-care facilities with limited resources may not have some types of hospital disinfectants. Alcohol and bleach are acceptable chemical disinfectants when used correctly. As with other disinfectants, soiled surfaces should be cleaned with water and detergent before applying alcohol or bleach. Alcohol Alcohol is effective against influenza viruses (229). Ethyl alcohol (70%) is an effective broad-spectrum germicide and is generally considered superior to isopropyl alcohol. Alcohol is often used to disinfect small surfaces (e.g., rubber stoppers of multi-dose medication bottles, and thermometers) and occasionally the external surfaces of equipment (e.g., stethoscopes and ventilators). Because alcohol is flammable, its use as a surface disinfectant should be limited to small surfaces and should only be used in well-ventilated areas. Alcohols can also cause discoloration, swelling, hardening, and cracking of rubber and certain plastics after prolonged, repeated use. Sodium hypochlorite (bleach) Bleach is a powerful and effective disinfectant, but it is easily inactivated in the presence of organic matter. The active ingredient, sodium hypochlorite, is effective at killing bacteria, fungi, and viruses, including influenza viruses. Diluted household bleach disinfects within a contact time of 10–60 minutes (see Table 7 for concentrations and contact times), is readily available and inexpensive, and can be recommended for surface disinfection in health care facilities. However, bleach is damaging to mucous membranes, skin, and the respiratory tract, decomposes on exposure to heat and light, and reacts readily with other chemicals. Therefore, caution is required when using bleach. Ventilation should be adequate and in accordance with applicable occupational safety and health guidelines. Improper use of bleach, including deviation from recommended dilution (more concentrated or less diluted), can reduce its disinfection effectiveness and may result in injury to health care workers. Procedure for preparing/using diluted bleach n Wear a mask, rubber gloves, and a waterproof apron. Safety glasses are also recommended to protect the eyes from splashes. n Mix and use the bleach solution in a well-ventilated area.n Mix bleach with cold water because hot water decomposes sodium hypochlorite and makes it ineffective. n Bleach containing 5% sodium hypochlorite should be diluted as shown in Table 7 below..'}","{'id': 'chunk-8d53cea9b2df40bf9306192ae60e76f5', 'content': '33.

The most common causes of iron deficiency anemia in children are inadequate intake accompanied by rapid growth, low birth weight, and gastrointestinal losses, for example due to excessive consumption of cow&#39;s milk. The most common clinical manifestation of iron deficiency is anemia. In mild anemia, most infants and children do not show severe clinical symptoms and signs. Based on WHO data in 2011 published by WHO in 2015, there were 273.2 million (95% CI: 241.8 - 303.7) children with anemia. Summary: Diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia involves clinical and laboratory examinations that include peripheral blood, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and serum iron. Early detection is needed because iron deficiency can occur before signs of anemia are found. The most commonly used early detection of iron deficiency is serum ferritin with a threshold that varies depending on age. Management of iron deficiency anemia in children involves changing high iron nutrition and giving iron preparations at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg/day in 2-3 divided doses. Key Message: Efforts to prevent and treat iron deficiency anemia are important so that children&#39;s growth and development can be optimal according to their age..'}","{'id': 'chunk-6bc98c366da6455cba8734c096be9c3e', 'content': '• Directorate of Madrasah Education • Directorate of Islamic Boarding Schools Regional Government: • Provincial and District/City Health Offices.\nWorm Control Program related to the Environment 1.

In contrast, a hypersensitivity reaction occurs when the body's immune system reacts to Mtb antigens, even if the bacteria aren't present in the eye. This reaction can be triggered by antigenic mimicry, where Mtb antigens resemble eye tissue antigens, causing the immune system to mistakenly attack the eye. Hypersensitivity reactions can manifest as phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis, posterior uveitis with occlusive retinal vasculitis, or serpiginoid choroiditis.",POSITIVE_1

Use of disinfectants: alcohol and bleach Different countries have different disinfection procedures. Health-care facilities with limited resources may not have some types of hospital disinfectants. Alcohol and bleach are acceptable chemical disinfectants when used correctly. As with other disinfectants, soiled surfaces should be cleaned with water and detergent before applying alcohol or bleach. Alcohol Alcohol is effective against influenza viruses (229). Ethyl alcohol (70%) is an effective broad-spectrum germicide and is generally considered superior to isopropyl alcohol. Alcohol is often used to disinfect small surfaces (e.g., rubber stoppers of multi-dose medication bottles, and thermometers) and occasionally the external surfaces of equipment (e.g., stethoscopes and ventilators). Because alcohol is flammable, its use as a surface disinfectant should be limited to small surfaces and should only be used in well-ventilated areas. Alcohols can also cause discoloration, swelling, hardening, and cracking of rubber and certain plastics after prolonged, repeated use. Sodium hypochlorite (bleach) Bleach is a powerful and effective disinfectant, but it is easily inactivated in the presence of organic matter. The active ingredient, sodium hypochlorite, is effective at killing bacteria, fungi, and viruses, including influenza viruses. Diluted household bleach disinfects within a contact time of 10–60 minutes (see Table 7 for concentrations and contact times), is readily available and inexpensive, and can be recommended for surface disinfection in health care facilities. However, bleach is damaging to mucous membranes, skin, and the respiratory tract, decomposes on exposure to heat and light, and reacts readily with other chemicals. Therefore, caution is required when using bleach. Ventilation should be adequate and in accordance with applicable occupational safety and health guidelines.

The following diagnostic steps should be taken:

1. **Physical Examination:** Check for fever (axillary temperature ≥ 37.5 °C), pale conjunctiva/palms, icteric sclera, and enlarged spleen/liver (splenomegaly/hepatomegaly).
2. **Laboratory Examination:**
    * **Microscopic Examination:** Examine thick and thin blood smears to identify malaria parasites, determine the species (e.g., Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax), stage, and parasite density.
    * **Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT):** While useful for quick diagnosis, RDTs detect parasite antigens and are not used for treatment evaluation.

Based on the findings, management would proceed as follows:

* **Uncomplicated Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum or P. vivax):**  Oral Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) plus primaquine is recommended. The ACT dosage is the same for both species. Primaquine is given at 0.25 mg/kg body weight, for one day in falciparum malaria, and for 14 days in vivax malaria (contraindicated in infants < 6 months).
* **Severe Malaria (P. falciparum with additional complications - see list in reference ""chunk-fdd4a5cd50b843c0a1d8633090119224""):** Intravenous artesunate followed by oral ACT is required.  RDTs can be used to inform immediate treatment in suspected severe malaria cases.

Respiratory protection A.1 High-risk aerosol-generating procedures Aerosols are produced when an air stream moves across the surface of a liquid film, generating small particles at the interface between the air and the liquid. The particle size is inversely proportional to the air velocity. Therefore, when a procedure causes air to move at high speed over the respiratory mucosa and epithelium, there is a risk of generating small aerosols (e.g., droplet nuclei). An aerosol-generating procedure is defined as any procedure performed on a patient that can generate aerosols of any size, including droplet nuclei. Several medical procedures have been reported to generate aerosols (71, 72, 100, 107, 143, 168-178), and some have been associated with an increased risk of pathogen transmission (Table 6) (71, 72, 100, 107, 130, 143, 168, 169, 171, 172, 174-182). Many of these studies have significant methodological weaknesses that preclude recommendations from these studies. In fact, the risks associated with many aerosol-generating procedures are not fully understood, and our understanding of the aerobiology of aerosol-generating procedures is likely to change and evolve as research continues in this area. Table 6 presents a selection of studies that have examined the risk of infection associated with these procedures. In these guidelines, the term “aerosol-generating procedures associated with a proven increased risk of pathogen transmission” refers to the following procedures performed on patients with ARI: n intubation and related procedures (e.g., manual ventilation, suctioning) (71, 72, 169); n cardiopulmonary resuscitation (169); n bronchoscopy (174, 175); n surgery and autopsy (130, 178).'}","{'id': 'chunk-a55938410ab14e16b4444272839c534d', 'content': 'Page 49 / 407\nReferences\nPatients Hb levels deﬁning\nanaemia Transfusion thresholds\nChildren 2-6 months < 9.5 g/dl Hb < 4 g/dl, even if there are no signs of\ndecompensation\nHb ≥ 4 g/dl and < 6 g/dl if there are signs of\ndecompensation or ongoing blood loss or severe\nmalaria or serious bacterial infection or pre-existing\nheart disease (a)\nChildren 6 months-4\xa0years < 11 g/dl\nChildren 5-11 years < 11.5 g/dl\nChildren 12-14 years < 12 g/dl\nMen\xa0(≥ 15 years) < 13 g/dl Hb < 7 g/dl if there are signs of decompensation or\nongoing blood loss or severe malaria or serious bacterial\ninfection or pre-existing heart diseaseWomen\xa0(≥ 15 years) < 12\xa0g/dl\nPregnant women\n\xa0\n< 11 g/dl\n(1 and 3 trimester)\xa0< 10.5 g/dl\n(2 trimester)\n\xa0\nst rd\nnd\n< 36 weeks\nHb ≤ 5 g/dl, even if there are no signs of\ndecompensation\nHb > 5 g/dl and < 7 g/dl if there are signs of\ndecompensation or sickle cell disease or severe\nmalaria or serious bacterial infection or pre-existing\nheart disease\n≥ 36 weeks\nHb ≤ 6 g/dl, even if there are no signs of\ndecompensation\nHb > 6 g/dl and < 8 g/dl if there are signs of\ndecompensation or sickle cell disease or severe\nmalaria or serious bacterial infection or pre-existing\nheart disease\n(a) Immediate transfusion is not required in children 2 months to 12 years with Hb ≥ 4 g/dl and < 6 g/dl and no sign ofdecompensation or ongoing blood loss, provided that:• they are closely monitored (including Hb measurements at 8, 24 and 48 hours), and• transfusion preparation (blood grouping, etc.) is carried out without delay in case the child needs to be transfused lateron.\nFootnotes\n(a) A coformulated tablet of ferrous salts/folic acid contains 185 mg of ferrous fumarate or sulfate (equivalent to 60 mg ofelemental iron) and 400 micrograms of folic acid.A 200 mg tablet of ferrous\xa0fumarate or sulfate contains 65 mg of elemental iron.A 140 mg/5 ml syrup of ferrous fumarate contains 45 mg/5 ml of elemental iron.\n(b) Before transfusing: determine the recipient’s and potential donors’ blood groups/rhesus and carry out screening tests onthe donor’s blood for HIV-1 and 2, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and, in endemic areas, malaria and Chagas disease.\n(c) Axillary temperature should be taken at the time of ordering blood\xa0and immediately prior to transfusion..'}","{'id': 'chunk-27e205df95c44ee084a6ce39ce859e5a', 'content': 'Page 167 / 407\n1.

CD4 count is useful for identifying severely\nimmunosuppressed. Other tests such as blood count, tests for liver (ALAT) and renal function (creatinine clearance) are\nnot essential, but can be useful in detecting adverse effects.\nTreatment of opportunistic and other infections\nWith progressive immunosuppression, HIV-infected patients who are not receiving triple therapy (or patients on ART\nbut with poor adherence) become increasingly susceptible to infections. For conditions of clinical stages 2 and 3,\nstandard treatments are usually effective. Patients may beneﬁt from primary prophylaxis against opportunistic\ninfections (see\xa0Primary prophylaxis).

A number of natural ventilation options may be useful to engineers and as a design solution they can adapt a particular technique to a particular building based on the advantages and disadvantages of each option. For a particular design, various combinations may be used for site and building design. The most commonly used basic methods are cross ventilation design and passive chimney method. Cross ventilation Cross ventilation allows outside air to flow through a room from one side to the other due to the force of the wind. This can usually be achieved by placing two openings facing each other, one on the windward side and one on the leeward side. A large window for a living room on the windward side will create a chimney effect, allowing more air to enter. Interior partitions and furniture should not obstruct the air flow. Large open spaces should always have large windows on opposite walls. As a general rule, the ACH for wind-generated natural ventilation through a room with two openings (e.g., a window and a door) facing each other, can be calculated as follows: Passive chimney ventilation Passive chimney ventilation allows outside air to flow through the chimney due to the combination of chimney pressure and the suction pressure caused by the wind. A chimney is a vertical pipe or duct. Air enters the building through a lower opening provided for this purpose and is discharged through the chimney. In order for this system to work properly, each room is equipped with a separate chimney, especially in the room where extraction is required. Sometimes, a central chimney is connected to the chimney branches of each room, but this can create a risk of cross-contamination between the connected rooms. The chimneys will not work alone. Air inlet must also be provided through a special opening. The end of the chimney above the roof must be placed in a negative pressure section to provide additional suction. If not properly designed, air flow reversals can occur. If this air flow reversal is only temporary, it will not cause problems for the air quality in the building, provided the air flow path is properly designed. Other methods Other methods include atrium ventilation, solar chimneys and wind towers, and can be combined with the building design to increase the effectiveness of natural ventilation (see Figure 8)..Air exchange rate = 0.8 x wind speed (m/sec) x smaller hole area x 3600 room volume.'}","{'id': 'chunk-ec327ee4371643d1a6813cfa4395b5ab', 'content': 'Diagnosis is often made from an endoscopic examination by looking at the tissue response after OAT therapy.

However, M. bovis can survive in the milk of infected cows and penetrate the gastrointestinal mucosa and invade the oropharyngeal lymphatic tissue when a person consumes milk from infected cows.

Etiology and transmission of TB There are 5 bacteria that are closely related to TB infection: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium microti and Mycobacterium cannettii.\nM. tuberculosis (M.TB), to date, is the most frequently found bacteria, and is transmitted between humans through the airborne route..\nNo animal has been found to act as a transmission agent for M.TB. However, M. bovis can survive in the milk of infected cows and penetrate the gastrointestinal mucosa and invade the oropharyngeal lymphatic tissue when a person consumes milk from infected cows. The incidence of M. bovis infection in humans has decreased significantly in developing countries, this is due to the process of milk pasteurization and the implementation of effective tuberculosis control strategies in livestock. Infection with other organisms is relatively rare.Tuberculosis is usually transmitted from person to person through the air through tiny droplets or droplet nuclei (&lt;5 microns) that are released when a person infected with pulmonary TB or laryngeal TB coughs, sneezes, or talks.

The heart rate is usually between 110-140 beats per minute. Other ECG findings may include aberrant conduction (Ashman phenomenon), preexcitation, left ventricular hypertrophy, bundle branch block, or signs of previous or acute myocardial infarction. To further confirm the diagnosis and guide management, additional tests like transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) are valuable for evaluating cardiac structures, valvular function, and detecting the presence of thrombi. Holter monitoring can help identify paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, while electrophysiological studies can be used to determine the site of curative ablation if necessary.",POSITIVE_2

Special blue fluorescent tubes are labeled F20T12/BB (General Electric, Westinghouse, Sylvania) or TL52/20W (Phillips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). It is important to note that special blue tubes provide a greater irradiance than regular blue tubes (labeled F20T12/B) (Figure 11). Special blue tubes are the most effective because they provide light that is predominantly in the blue-green spectrum..At this wavelength, light easily penetrates the skin and is maximally absorbed by bilirubin.

A number of natural ventilation options may be useful to engineers and as a design solution they can adapt a particular technique to a particular building based on the advantages and disadvantages of each option. For a particular design, various combinations may be used for site and building design. The most commonly used basic methods are cross ventilation design and passive chimney method. Cross ventilation Cross ventilation allows outside air to flow through a room from one side to the other due to the force of the wind. This can usually be achieved by placing two openings facing each other, one on the windward side and one on the leeward side. A large window for a living room on the windward side will create a chimney effect, allowing more air to enter. Interior partitions and furniture should not obstruct the air flow. Large open spaces should always have large windows on opposite walls. As a general rule, the ACH for wind-generated natural ventilation through a room with two openings (e.g., a window and a door) facing each other, can be calculated as follows: Passive chimney ventilation Passive chimney ventilation allows outside air to flow through the chimney due to the combination of chimney pressure and the suction pressure caused by the wind. A chimney is a vertical pipe or duct. Air enters the building through a lower opening provided for this purpose and is discharged through the chimney. In order for this system to work properly, each room is equipped with a separate chimney, especially in the room where extraction is required. Sometimes, a central chimney is connected to the chimney branches of each room, but this can create a risk of cross-contamination between the connected rooms. The chimneys will not work alone. Air inlet must also be provided through a special opening. The end of the chimney above the roof must be placed in a negative pressure section to provide additional suction.

The expectation of a 67% reduction in toddler mortality in 2015 was not achieved. Infant mortality in 2015 was still quite high, around 26.2 per 1000 live births.

The spread and impact of the disease are related to (15-17): n environmental conditions (e.g., air pollutants, family density), humidity, hygiene, season, temperature); n availability and effectiveness of health services and infection control measures to prevent spread (e.g., vaccines, access to health care facilities, isolation room capacity); n host factors, such as age, smoking habits, host&#39;s ability to transmit infection, immune status, nutritional status, previous or concurrent infections caused by other pathogens, general health conditions; and n pathogen characteristics, such as mode of transmission, transmissibility, virulence factors (e.g., toxin-coding genes), and microbial load or dose (inoculum size).

Respiratory protection A.1 High-risk aerosol-generating procedures Aerosols are produced when an air stream moves across the surface of a liquid film, generating small particles at the interface between the air and the liquid. The particle size is inversely proportional to the air velocity. Therefore, when a procedure causes air to move at high speed over the respiratory mucosa and epithelium, there is a risk of generating small aerosols (e.g., droplet nuclei). An aerosol-generating procedure is defined as any procedure performed on a patient that can generate aerosols of any size, including droplet nuclei. Several medical procedures have been reported to generate aerosols (71, 72, 100, 107, 143, 168-178), and some have been associated with an increased risk of pathogen transmission (Table 6) (71, 72, 100, 107, 130, 143, 168, 169, 171, 172, 174-182). Many of these studies have significant methodological weaknesses that preclude recommendations from these studies. In fact, the risks associated with many aerosol-generating procedures are not fully understood, and our understanding of the aerobiology of aerosol-generating procedures is likely to change and evolve as research continues in this area. Table 6 presents a selection of studies that have examined the risk of infection associated with these procedures. In these guidelines, the term “aerosol-generating procedures associated with a proven increased risk of pathogen transmission” refers to the following procedures performed on patients with ARI: n intubation and related procedures (e.g., manual ventilation, suctioning) (71, 72, 169); n cardiopulmonary resuscitation (169); n bronchoscopy (174, 175); n surgery and autopsy (130, 178).'}","{'id': 'chunk-bd8ff043fa8640b28c9844e6b2ead7ce', 'content': '191\nINFECTIOUS DISEASES\n \x81 Secondary stage : begins approximately 9 weeks after initial infection; \nspeciﬁ c exanthems and enanthems called syphilids \n Exanthem: monomorphic macular or maculopapular lesions on trunk/ o\nextremities including palms and soles with ham or copper color (can \nresemble pityriasis rosea or lichen planus) \n Condyloma lata: moist papular syphilids in genital area at mucocutane- o\nous junction \n Lues maligna: rare form, necrotic papulopustular lesions which ulcerate o\nwith dirty crust; fever, chills \n Alopecia: localized, diffuse, or “ o moth-eaten ” pattern \n Mucous patches: silver to gray superﬁ cial erosions typically involving o\nthe tongue, palate, or lips \n \x81 Tertiary stage : begins approximately 3–5 years after secondary syphilis\n Gummata (singular gumma): syphilitic granulomas involving skin, oral o\ncavity, and/or bones \n Cardiovascular syphilis o\n Neurosyphilis: tabes dorsalis, Argyll Robertson pupil o\n Serology: two types (nonspeciﬁ c and speciﬁ c to bacterium) \x81 \n Nontreponemal tests: become \x81 nonreactive over time and after treatment \n o RPR (rapid plasma reagin): detects IgM/IgG antibodies against \n“reagin,” a puriﬁ ed mixture of lipids including cardiolipin , lecithin , and \n cholesterol ; used as screening test and also to track progress/response \nto therapy; expressed as titer \n o VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test): same antigen as \nRPR \n RPR/VDRL may not be reactive in primary syphilis until at least o\n 1 week after chancre appears \n False positive result may be seen with certain viral infections, immuni- o\nzations, lymphoma, autoimmune disease ( i.e., lupus) , pregnancy , \n malaria , and increasing age \n Treponemal tests: most often reactive for life\x81 \n o FTA-ABS (ﬂ uorescent treponemal antibody absorption test): usually \npositive by third week of infection, remains positive after treatment , \nmost sensitive test in primary syphilis \n False positive: rare o\n Treatment:\x81 \n o Single dose of IM benzathine PCN G 2.4 million IU (if PCN allergic: \nuse TCN, doxycycline, or azithromycin) \n o Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction : febrile systemic reaction after initial dose \nof antisyphilitic treatment in about 75% patients \nA\nB\nC\n Figure 4.16 \n A: Secondary syphilis*\nB: Secondary syphilis*\nC: Secondary syphilis, mucous patches* \n *Courtesy of Dr. Paul Getz \n .'}","{'id': 'chunk-2f3255c928b84c979d76190523c49819', 'content': 'b) Freyss Tonus assesses the tonus function at each level of the facial muscle group, not each muscle.

Photoisomers are mostly excreted in bile and oxidation products are mostly excreted in urine.

Measuring phototherapy ""dose"" is challenging due to the lack of standardization. While the term ""intensity"" is used clinically and measured with radiometers, different devices can yield different readings, especially under lamps with focused emission spectra.

Another study suggested trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may reduce otorrhea in chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), a condition related to OMSK. While some studies have compared specific antibiotics like cefotiam versus amoxicillin-clavulanate and levofloxacin versus amoxicillin-clavulanate, no single oral antibiotic has been definitively proven most effective for OMSK management.",POSITIVE_4

Leukocytes of patients infected with TB will produce interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) when in contact with antigens from M. tuberculosis. Currently, there are several IGRA kits that can be used.

Other kits measure the immune response by measuring the number of cells that produce IFN-γ.It should be noted that the IGRA test cannot be used to diagnose active TB, but is only used to diagnose latent TB..\nIGRA interpretation can be qualitative and quantitative..\nQualitative interpretations are reported as positive, negative, and indeterminate or borderline.

This decrease will stimulate the respiratory center, so that the breathing rate is faster and deeper (Kussmaul). This reaction is the body&#39;s attempt to excrete carbonic acid so that the pH can return to normal. In a state of uncompensated metabolic acidosis, standard bicarbonate is also low, pCO2 is normal, and base excess is very negative.2-4 Cardiovascular disorders in severe hypovolemia can be in the form of shock with signs of rapid pulse, blood pressure decreases to the point of being unmeasurable. Patients begin to feel restless, their faces are pale, their extremities are cold, and sometimes cyanotic. Loss of potassium can also cause cardiac arrhythmias.2-4 Decreased blood pressure will cause decreased renal perfusion and anuria will occur; if not treated immediately, complications will arise in the form of acute renal tubular necrosis, which means acute renal failure. If metabolic acidosis becomes more severe, pulmonary circulation will be centralized and can cause pulmonary edema in patients receiving intravenous fluid rehydration without alkali.2-4 Laboratory Examination Laboratory evaluation of patients suspected of infectious diarrhea begins with stool examination. Stool usually does not contain leukocytes, if present, it is considered a marker of colonic inflammation, both infectious and non-infectious. The sample should be examined as soon as possible because neutrophils change rapidly. The sensitivity of fecal leukocytes to inflammatory pathogens (Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter) detected by stool culture varies from 45% - 95% depending on the type of pathogen.2-4 A more stable marker for intestinal inflammation is lactoferrin. Lactoferrin is an iron-coated glycoprotein released by neutrophils, its presence in the stool indicates colonic inflammation. False positives can occur in breastfed infants. In one study, fecal lactoferrin was detected using a commercial latex agglutination test, the sensitivity was 83-93% and the specificity was 61-100% against Salmonella, Campylobacter, or Shigella spp, detected from stool culture.2-4 Stool culture should be performed in every patient suspected or suffering from inflammatory diarrhea based on clinical and epidemiological, positive stool leukocyte or lactoferrin examination, or both. In bloody diarrhea, stool culture should be performed for EHEC O157: H7.2-4 In patients with severe diarrhea with fever, abdominal pain, or fluid loss, blood chemistry, sodium, potassium, chloride, urea, creatinine, blood gas analysis, and complete blood count should be checked.2-4 Radiological examinations, such as sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy and others, are usually not helpful in evaluating acute infectious diarrhea.2-4 Some Causes of Acute Bacterial Infectious Diarrhea a. Non-invasive infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Vibrio cholerae, pathogenic Escherichia coli. b. Invasive infections: Shigella, Salmonella nontyphoid, Salmonella typhi, Campylobacter, Vibrio non-cholera, Yersinia, Entero- hemorrhagic E. coli (subtype 0157), Aeromonas, Plesiomonas. Approach to adult patients with acute diarrhea:3 1. Perform initial assessment. 2. Treat dehydration. 3. Prevent dehydration in patients without signs of dehydration using fluids or oral rehydration solutions: a) Rehydrate patients with moderate dehydration using oral rehydration solutions and correct severe dehydration with appropriate intravenous solutions, b) Provide hydration using oral rehydration solutions, c) Treat symptoms. 4. Management stratification: a) Epidemiological clues: food, antibiotics, sexual activity, travel, other diseases, epidemics, season. b) Clinical clues: bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, dysentery, weight loss, fecal inﬂammation. 5. Collecting fecal specimens for analysis: If diarrhea is severe, inﬂammatory, bloody or persistent, and at the beginning of an outbreak or epidemic. 6. Considering antimicrobial therapy for speciﬁc pathogens. MANAGEMENT A. FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE REPLACEMENT The most important aspect is to maintain adequate hydration and electrolyte balance during the acute episode. This is done by oral rehydration, which should be performed on all patients, unless they are unable to drink or have severe life-threatening diarrhea requiring intravenous hydration. Ideally, an oral rehydration solution should consist of 3.5 grams of sodium chloride, 2.5 grams of sodium bicarbonate, 1.5 grams of potassium chloride, and 20 grams of glucose per liter of water. Such solutions are commercially available in packets that are easy to prepare by mixing with water. If commercially available, a replacement oral rehydration solution can be prepared by adding ½ teaspoon of salt, ½ teaspoon of baking soda, and 2-4 tablespoons of sugar per liter of water. Two bananas or 1 cup of orange juice are given to replace potassium. The patient should drink as much of the fluid as possible from the first feeling of thirst. If intravenous therapy is required, a normotonic fluid, such as normal saline or lactated Ringer&#39;s, may be given; potassium supplements are given according to blood chemistry guidelines..'}","{'id': 'chunk-7731a656cdbc48f8bee2cc3371de9821', 'content': 'Page 398 / 407\nTreatment of ﬂuid retention\nfurosemide\xa0PO: start with 20 mg once daily; increase if necessary, according to clinical response (certain patients\nneed doses of 80 mg 1 to 2 times daily) then reduce once oedema\xa0decrease\xa0(20 to 40 mg once daily).\xa0The reabsorption of oedema can sometimes be slow, taking up to 2 to 3 weeks.\nThe gradual worsening of HF may require\xa0an increase in dosage.

Of particular importance is the level of ventilation (i.e., ACH) in the room when there is a possibility of droplet nuclei transmission. Table 2 provides information on the relationship of ventilation level to the reduction in droplet nuclei concentration in isolation rooms with different ventilation levels, using the concentration reduction equation (133). The assumptions for this equation are: 1) ACH remains constant; and 2) the concentration of droplet nuclei in the confined space is uniform (which is usually not the case in real situations). Using the concentration reduction equation, 10 times the decomposition occurs in 10 minutes with 15 ACH. Because the quantity or number of particles produced is not uniform in a health care facility, adequate ventilation can reduce but not eliminate the risk of infection, and thus appropriate PPE is required.

Many infectious diseases have animal reservoirs and can infect humans under certain circumstances. The following factors have been shown to be associated with the emergence and spread of infectious diseases (14, 30): n changes in human demographics and behavior n impact of new technologies and industry n economic development and changes in land use n increased international travel and trade n adaptation and change in microbes n failure of public health programs, and n living in the same environment as domestic or wild animals or birds. These factors can facilitate transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans and from humans to humans. When a new infectious disease is recognized, its mode of transmission is not fully understood. Epidemiological and microbiological studies to help determine the mode of transmission and to identify possible preventive and control measures may be required. Because of the lack of information on the mode of transmission, Airborne and Contact Precautions should be used in addition to Standard Precautions whenever possible to reduce the risk of transmission of an emerging agent. These precautions should be used until further research reveals the mode of transmission. Indications that additional precautions are needed include epidemiological and clinical signs, as described in section IV.1. These indications may change as new information becomes available. Close surveillance of health-care workers should continue at the beginning and throughout an outbreak caused by a novel pathogen, as this pathogen may be an important source of information on the mode of transmission, both for transmission outside the hospital and for transmission associated with the hospital.

In Southeast Asia, asphyxia is the third highest cause of death (23%) after neonatal infection (36%) and prematurity/low birth weight (LBW) (27%). The 2001 Household Health Survey (SKRT) in Indonesia also reported asphyxia as the cause of 27% of newborn deaths.

This should be prescribed and supervised by a pediatrician. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 10-15% of energy intake from protein for catch-up growth.  Animal proteins are generally of high quality, often having a Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS) of 100 or greater.

The\ninfection is noncontagious.\nClostridium tetani\xa0is introduced into the body through a wound and produces a toxin whose action on the central\nnervous system is responsible for the symptoms of tetanus.\nTetanus is entirely preventable by vaccination. It occurs in people who have not been fully vaccinated before exposure\nor have not received adequate post-exposure prophylaxis. In these individuals, most breaks in the skin or mucous\nmembranes carry a risk of tetanus, but the wounds with the greatest risk are: the stump of the umbilical cord in\nneonates, puncture wounds, wounds with tissue loss or contamination with foreign material or soil, avulsion and crush\ninjuries, sites of non-sterile injections, chronic wounds (e.g. lower extremity ulcers), burns and bites. Surgical or\nobstetrical procedures performed under non-sterile conditions also carry a risk of tetanus.\nClinical features\nGeneralised tetanus is the most frequent and severe form of the infection. It presents as muscular rigidity, which\nprogresses rapidly to involve the entire body, and muscle spasms, which are very painful. Level of consciousness is not\naltered.\nChildren and adults\nNeonates\nTreatment\nHospitalisation is needed and usually lasts 3 to 4 weeks. Correct management can reduce mortality even in hospitals\nwith limited resources.\nGeneral measures\nAverage time from exposure to onset of symptoms is 7 days (3 to 21 days).\nMuscular rigidity begins in the jaw muscles (difﬁculty with then inability to open mouth [trismus] preventing the patient\nfrom speaking, eating), spreading to the face (ﬁxed smile), neck (difﬁculty with swallowing), to the trunk (restriction\nof respiratory muscles; hyperextension of spine [opisthotonus]), to the abdomen (guarding) and to the limbs (ﬂexion\nof the upper limbs and extension of the lower limbs).\nMuscle spasms, which are very painful, appear at the onset or when muscular rigidity becomes generalised. They\nare triggered by stimuli (noise, light, touch) or arise spontaneously. Spasms of the thoracic and laryngeal muscles\nmay cause respiratory distress or aspiration.\nIn 90% of cases, initial symptoms appear within 3 to 14 days of birth.\nThe ﬁrst signs are signiﬁcant irritability and difﬁculty sucking (rigidity of the lips, trismus) then rigidity becomes\ngeneralised, as in adults. Any neonate, who initially sucked and cried normally, presenting with irritability and difﬁculty\nsucking 3 to 28 days after birth and demonstrating rigidity and muscle spasms should be assumed to have neonatal\ntetanus.\nEnsure intensive nursing care.\nThe patient should be in a dark, quiet room.

Of particular importance is the level of ventilation (i.e., ACH) in the room when there is a possibility of droplet nuclei transmission. Table 2 provides information on the relationship of ventilation level to the reduction in droplet nuclei concentration in isolation rooms with different ventilation levels, using the concentration reduction equation (133). The assumptions for this equation are: 1) ACH remains constant; and 2) the concentration of droplet nuclei in the confined space is uniform (which is usually not the case in real situations). Using the concentration reduction equation, 10 times the decomposition occurs in 10 minutes with 15 ACH. Because the quantity or number of particles produced is not uniform in a health care facility, adequate ventilation can reduce but not eliminate the risk of infection, and thus appropriate PPE is required.

INTRODUCTION Anemia in children is defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the average hemoglobin value for the child&#39;s age. [1] Based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2011 published in 2015, there were 273.2 million children with anemia. As many as 9.6 million children have severe anemia. Children in Southeast Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Africa have an average hemoglobin concentration between 104 and 109 g/L (below the threshold for mild anemia).

In several studies, the benefits of prophylaxis with iron supplementation in the form of drops were found to be inadequate compared to supplementation with food products or formula.[40,41] The most ideal way to meet the need for iron is to improve the quality of food products, especially animal products.[5] On the other hand, WHO recommends iron supplementation for three consecutive months in one year in children living in environments with an anemia prevalence of 40% or higher. In children aged 6–23 months, the recommended dose of iron supplementation is 10–12.5 mg of elemental iron per day in the form of drops/syrup. In children aged 24–59 months, the recommended dose of supplementation is 30 mg of elemental iron per day in the form of drops/syrup/tablets. In children aged 5–12 years, elemental iron supplementation is given at 30–60 mg per day in the form of tablets or capsules.[42] Other preventive efforts recommended in the consensus are prevention of premature birth, delayed clamping of the umbilical cord especially in premature babies, exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months, provision of complementary foods at a different time from breastfeeding, avoiding cow&#39;s milk before one year, use of iron-fortified formula if breastfeeding is inadequate, and consumption of foods high in heme iron.[4,43,44] 7. MANAGEMENT The main principles of iron deficiency anemia management include establishing a diagnosis, investigating conditions that cause iron deficiency and treating these conditions, iron replacement, improving nutrition and educating parents and families. Iron in food is found in two forms, namely heme iron and non-heme iron. Non-heme iron is found in food products other than meat and heme iron is found in meat products and their processed products. Heme iron absorption is much higher, but only 10% of iron in food is heme iron. While heme iron absorption is almost unaffected by environmental factors, non-heme iron absorption is affected by other food substances and environmental pH so increasing meat and meat product consumption is very important to prevent and treat iron deficiency. Other foods rich in iron include eggs, green vegetables, and dried fruit.[5] The current literature is limited regarding the administration of iron therapy for iron deficiency..There are many different recommendations regarding the dosage, content, duration of therapy, and follow-up of iron therapy in different publications. There are many iron preparations with different contents on the market and some are referred to as dietary supplements. Oral iron therapy is preferred because it is economical and side effects are rare. Iron preparations can be found in the form of ferrous salts or.'}","['chunk-1545ddef062f42ac9926cfcfa57b6ba6', 'chunk-30a5f97e035e4fafa83bc8c66d34fa12']",2,"HLA-B27 is a genetic marker associated with several conditions discussed.

In patients with inadequate immune systems, for example in HIV patients, atypical signs and symptoms can occur. In TB-HIV patients, cavities are usually not seen on chest X-rays. However, even though there is no or little tissue damage due to the host&#39;s immune response in TB-HIV patients, the low immune response makes it easier for TB bacteria to proliferate and spread.

In immunocompromised individuals, like those with HIV, the disease manifests differently. Cavities might be absent on chest X-rays due to the weakened immune response, but the reduced immune function allows for greater bacterial proliferation and dissemination, leading to manifestations like miliary TB, frequently observed in TB-HIV co-infected patients.

* **IL-1:** Produced by keratinocytes and macrophages, IL-1 is a potent proinflammatory cytokine that triggers the innate inflammatory response. It induces fever, increases production of acute-phase reactants, and promotes the expression of adhesion molecules on vascular endothelial cells, enhancing chemotaxis.  
* **IL-6:** Primarily produced by lymphoid cells and endothelial cells, IL-6 also acts as a proinflammatory cytokine. It contributes to the production of acute-phase proteins, stimulates B cells to differentiate into plasma cells and increase antibody secretion, and promotes neutrophil production, further amplifying the inflammatory response.
* **TNF-α:** Produced by various cells, including T cells, monocytes, mast cells, and keratinocytes, TNF-α is another key proinflammatory cytokine. It stimulates the release of other proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1 and IL-6, upregulates MHC I and II expression, activates T and B cells, and induces fever and catabolism (cachexia), contributing significantly to the overall inflammatory picture.
* **IL-10:** Produced by Th2 cells and keratinocytes, IL-10 acts as an anti-inflammatory cytokine. It inhibits proinflammatory cytokines, downregulates the activity of macrophages and dendritic cells, activates B cells, and downregulates the Th1 response.  IL-10's presence helps to modulate the inflammatory response and limit potential tissue damage.

Currently, surgical masks and respirators should be discarded after use for such patient care. Entry of HCWs into isolation rooms Other issues to consider when making assumption planning include the expected frequency of HCWs entering the isolation room, whether a PPE will be reused by the same HCW during a work shift, and how many HCWs will enter the isolation room. All of these factors are directly related to how much PPE will be used. The number of HCWs entering the isolation room and the frequency of each HCW’s entry should be limited to the minimum necessary for patient care. To reduce the number of HCWs entering the isolation room, tasks should be performed by as few HCWs as possible. Another way to reduce the frequency of HCWs entering the isolation room is to provide a means of communication between the patient/patient’s family in the treatment room and HCWs outside the treatment room via telephone or other means. Patient pooling may reduce the need for PPE because some patients must be seen without the HCW leaving the isolation room.
